        I’m a student exploring the timeless art of film
        photography. What started as a curiosity has quickly grown into a
        passion for capturing life’s fleeting moments in a way that feels
        authentic and meaningful. There’s something special about the analog
        process—the slow, deliberate nature of composing a shot, the thrill of
        waiting for film to develop, and the beauty in the unexpected.

        For me, photography is about storytelling. Whether it’s a quiet
        portrait, a vibrant street scene, or a tranquil landscape, I aim to
        create images that evoke emotion and preserve the essence of the moment.
        Film has taught me to pay attention to the details—the way light and
        shadow interact, the textures that often go unnoticed, and the subtle
        shifts in perspective that can transform an image. It’s a craft that
        constantly challenges me to grow, experiment, and see the world with
        fresh eyes.

        As a student, photography provides a creative outlet and a welcome
        balance to my academic life. It’s a space where I can learn, make
        mistakes, and embrace the imperfections that make each shot unique. I’m
        excited to share my journey, document my growth, and connect with others
        who share a love for analog photography.
